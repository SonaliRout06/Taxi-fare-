# Taxi Fare Prediction

# 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts taxi fares using machine learning techniques based on trip-related features such as distance, time, and passenger details. The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate fare amounts accurately.

# 🧠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

# 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains historical taxi trip data including pickup and drop-off information, distance, and fare amount. Data preprocessing and feature engineering are applied before training the model.

# 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially

# 📈 Model Details
